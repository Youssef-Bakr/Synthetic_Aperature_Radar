# BuildYourOwnSyntheticAperatureRadar

## Introduction
This Github resporatiry collects resources for R&D SAR. It is mainly inspired by Gregory L. Charvat, who is the author of 'Small and Short-Range Radar Systems'.  

## Get Started 
The following materials will help you to work on this project:
1. Book 'Small and Short-Range Radar Systems' - [AmazonLink](https://www.amazon.ca/Small-Short-Range-Systems-Gregory-Charvat/dp/1138077631/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?keywords=small+and+short+range+radar&qid=1560888556&s=gateway&sr=8-2-fkmr1)
2. MIT Opencourseware - [link](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ll-003-build-a-small-radar-system-capable-of-sensing-range-doppler-and-synthetic-aperture-radar-imaging-january-iap-2011/index.htm)
